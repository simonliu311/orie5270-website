This is the miscellaneous section of my website. Since I've added important information about myself on the other pages, I've decided to add a little bit of poetry here. Note that this isn't my original work, but just some exerpts that I appreciate.

*Hail, Cornell!*

Cornell, they call it, a beacon of the East,  
A symbol of the best that we can be,  
A place where science, art, and knowledge meet,  
And shape the future of humanity. 

And yet this place it more than just a school,  
A shelter from the cold or summer's heat,  
For it's a home where friendships bloom and rule,  
And love and laughter fill the campus streets.

So here's to Cornell, our alma mater true,  
A place that we shall cherish all our days,  
For it has shaped us, made us what we knew,  
And blessed us with its light in myriad ways.
