I've worked on many projects in my time at Cornell University. Here are a few I'm proud of:

Ambulance Response Simulation: I completed the development of a simulation model to evaluate different methods for placing ambulances in order to respond to Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests.

Command Line Blackjack: I drove the design and development of a Blackjack training tool for learning Blackjack basic strategy and card-counting. Developed in oCaml.

Twitter Emotion Categorization: I implemented and trained a Recurrent Neural Network using PyTorch for classifying the emotion of a Twitter post. I refined this model using hyper-parameter tuning, ultimately achieving accuracy of 81% on unseen data.
