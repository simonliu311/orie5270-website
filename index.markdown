My name is Simon, and I’m currently a M.Eng Candidate studying Financial Engineering at Cornell University. I’m very interested in the design and analysis of computer algorithms, and the study and understanding of analytical data for business. I’ve also taken up an interest in the stock market, and I’m striving to learn more about the fundamentals of investing and the drivers of macroeconomic growth. I’m very curious to learn and discuss more about these topics, so please feel free to shoot me an email or phone call if you’d like to have a chat!
